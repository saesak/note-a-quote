# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a toy project I used to learn React.js. It allows you to jot down notes in different rows. Functionally, it is similar to a todo list, but by clicking on the different rows, you can access extra information about the tasks.
